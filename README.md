Hi I'm Claudia and welcome to my repo!

Since last year I have learnt some new tools for me like Vue 3, Nuxt, and more and still I am improving skills by building websites - wondering how can I do it better from project to project?
From CSS libraries I use Bootstrp, Bulma and Tailwind. However my favourite is Bootstrap (Don't ask me why :D)

I am self-taught, taking online courses and writting code. I am aware that I do not have the experience of older colleagues, but I will!
I really like when my code immediately becomes a real picture of my work that's why I choose frontend. 
However I am taking steps into backend to build full web aplication. I use some php scripts on hostings and carefully move with Node.js online course.

On websites which I build I am using php + mySQL databases.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...? I have built my profile website www.gibekdev.pl - I encourage you to visit ! :)
âš¡ Fun fact: I like american muscle cars that's why Camaro is on my avatar :))))
